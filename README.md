# Placesfy

Placesfy is a Progressive Web App where you offer and book places

The app has been developed during the [Build Native iOS & Android as well as Progressive Web Apps with Angular, Capacitor and the Ionic Framework (Ionic 4+)](https://www.udemy.com/course/ionic-2-the-practical-guide-to-building-ios-android-apps/) course by **Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller** in Udemy.

## App description

The app contains the following pages:

- auth
- bookings
  - create-booking
- places
  - discover
    - place-detail
  - offers
    - edit-offer
    - new-offer
    - offer-item

## External services

### Google maps

The Google Map integration allows the user to select the address of the place they want to offer using Google Maps.

In addition to this, a preview of the address is generated and stored as part of the offer.

For this the [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) has been used.

### Firebase

Firebase is used as backend to store the places availables and booked by the user.

It is also used to authenticate the users.

## How to run

In order to run the application you need to create the following files:

### src/environments/environment.ts

There you need to set some API keys and urls

```
export const environment = {
    googleMapsAPIKey: "",
    firebaseURL: "",
    firebaseImageAPI: "",
    firebaseAPIKey: ""
  };
```

You can get your own API keys and urls from here:

- [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)

* [Firebase URL](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40168564/where-can-i-find-my-firebase-reference-url-in-firebase-account)

* [Firebase Image API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started)

  - This API is the result of deploying the function **storeImage** from functions/index.js

* [Firebase API Key](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40168564/where-can-i-find-my-firebase-reference-url-in-firebase-account)

### functions/ionic-app.json

This file is the result of generating a private key in the **Firebase project page**, under Project **Settings > Service account > Generate new private key**
